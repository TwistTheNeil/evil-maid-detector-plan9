# Evil Maid Detector (Plan9)

This project is one I wrote for a class. It is written for the [plan9](https://9p.io/plan9/) platform.

It is a simple project which uses the following components:
* [Adafruit Triple-Axis Accelerometer - Â±2/4/8g @ 14-bit - MMA8451](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2019)
* [Adafruit FONA 808 - Mini Cellular GSM + GPS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2542)
* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* A battery and a power booster to power the pi without the need for a connection
to the wall power outlet

It tries to detect an [evil maid attack](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/159173/what-exactly-is-an-evil-maid-attack) and is inspired by [Haven](https://www.wired.com/story/snowden-haven-app-turns-phone-into-home-security-system/).

The idea is that in order for an attacker to physically access your laptop, they
must first disturb anything which is on top of it. The accelerometer will pick
up motion and tilts and the cellular breakout will notify the owner of an
attempt via a text message using the FONA breakout. Of course, this will have
false alerts especially if you have a cat.
